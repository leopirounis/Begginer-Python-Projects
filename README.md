# Python Projects Repository 🚀

This repository contains a collection of Python projects that demonstrate my progress in learning core programming concepts and building interactive applications.

The projects include practical utilities such as a QR code generator, password generator, password strength checker, credit card validator, encryption program, currency converter, compound interest calculator, temperature converter, and email slicer. 
I also built real-world simulations like a banking program, shopping cart system, slot machine, concession stand, to-do list, and simple text editor.
These projects highlight my understanding of Python fundamentals including variables, conditionals, loops, functions, input validation, and basic algorithms.

In addition to utility programs, the repository features a variety of games and interactive programs such as Hangman, Tic Tac Toe, Rock Paper Scissors, Cows and Bulls, Pig Dice, number guessing games, quiz games, dice rolling simulations, countdown timers, and word guessing games.


These projects focus on user interaction, control flow, randomness, and logical problem-solving. Overall, this repository reflects consistent hands-on practice with Python and serves as a strong foundation for developing more advanced software projects.
